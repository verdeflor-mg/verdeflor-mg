'Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head. Now, repeat after me. As soon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on yonder island, and remain there six days.

<p>In this post you will learn how to create a RESTful microservice
	from scratch using Spring-Boot, Eclipse & Maven.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>Spring boot is one of the very popular frameworks to build
	microservices. In fact it has been chosen to be the standard for JBoss
	Fuse (Fuse Integration Services 2.0) deployments on Openshift. It can

	surprised how easy it is to create standalone packages that are capable
	of running production grade services.</p>
